## Motivation

I chose **DevOps** because I love exploring new things, solving errors, and building automation — it gives me a vibe and thrill.  

Through this 4-week learning journey, I want to show recruiters and everyone that **anyone can achieve something meaningful in just 4 weeks**, even if they start from zero, just like me.  

My personal goal is to **scale up my learning, gain confidence, and showcase my ability to apply DevOps in real projects**, which can help me land an internship or a job.

## My 4-Week DevOps Journey

I approached this as a **project-based learning plan**:

- **Week 1 – Docker:** Learned containerization and built basic Docker apps.  
- **Week 2 – CI/CD:** Implemented automated build and deployment pipelines.  
- **Week 3 – Orchestration:** Explored Kubernetes, scaling, and load balancing.  
- **Week 4 – Cloud & Portfolio:** Deployed apps on cloud platforms, combined everything into a portfolio project.  

I dedicated **5–7 hours per day**, tackling obstacles like **financial limitations**, and used this project to **gain confidence and practical skills**.
